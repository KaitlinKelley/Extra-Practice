        We use the integers , , and  to create the following series:

        You are given  queries in the form of , , and . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given , , and  values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

        Input Format

        The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
        Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective , , and  values for that query.

        Constraints

        Output Format

        For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

        Sample Input

        2
        0 2 10
        5 3 5
        Sample Output

        2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
        8 14 26 50 98
        Explanation

        We have two queries:

        We use , , and  to produce some series :

        ... and so on.

        Once we hit , we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

        We use , , and  to produce some series :

        We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.
